# Linear Regression using tensorflow.

This project focuses on predicting the prices of houses in boston area. Dataset used in this project is boston housing dataset which is also present on scikit-learn library which can be imported into the project using load_boston() function.

## Getting Started

For this project make sure thorough knowledge of machine learning algorithms like linear regression, Logistic regression etc is present. Basic knowledge of tensorflow is must to understand this project. Apart from this, implmentation details of dataset extraction must be known like usage of numpy, pandas and other standered python libraries.

### Prerequisites

Packages needed:
```
  Jupyter notebook
  tensorflow library
  numpy
  pandas
  scikit-learn
  matplotlib
```

### Running the project

Make sure [ipython notebook](http://jupyter.org/) is installed in the system.
Type following command in the terminal.
```
git clone https://github.com/keyurparalkar/Linear-Regression-with-tensorflow.git
cd [to_the_project_path]
jupyter notebook
```
